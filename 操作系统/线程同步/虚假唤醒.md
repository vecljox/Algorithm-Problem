There are at least two things 'spurious wakeup' could mean:
“虚假唤醒”至少可以有两种含义：

A thread blocked in pthread_cond_wait can return from the call even though no call to pthread_cond_signal or pthread_cond_broadcast on the condition occurred.
被阻塞在 pthread_cond_wait 的线程可以从调用中返回，即使在条件上没有调用 pthread_cond_signal 或 pthread_cond_broadcast 。

A thread blocked in pthread_cond_wait returns because of a call to pthread_cond_signal or pthread_cond_broadcast, however after reacquiring the mutex the underlying predicate is found to no longer be true.
在 pthread_cond_wait 中被阻塞的线程因为对 pthread_cond_signal 或 pthread_cond_broadcast 的调用而返回，但在重新获取互斥锁后发现基础谓词不再为真。
